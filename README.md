# Bucketbee

## Lifestyle app for global citizens

Bucketbee is a mobile app designed to help frequent travellers and global citizens keep tabs on their favourite people and places. 
1. It helps users connect with close friends and family conveniently with "quick actions" such as sending out location updates.
2. Users can create buckets, in which they can categorize and customize their favorite places for future reference.  
3. Users can personalize their own places, digital postcards, and even profile style.

# Getting started

### The client and server for this project has been split up into two separate repos; both need to be up and running for the app to be functional. Find the client [here](https://github.com/pamelakaylin/Bucketbee_Client).

#### 1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/pamelakaylin/Bucketbee_Server.git
```
#### 2. Navigate into the root folder and install the dependencies

```
npm install
```
#### 3. Database

- Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running! Run the following command with Homebrew to check 
```
brew services list 
```

- Create an .env file and add DB_NAME=[your_db_name_here]

#### 4. Start the server!
```
node index.js
```
or if you have Nodemon installed
```
nodemon
```

#### 5. Set up the client if you haven't already done so

- You can find instructions in the client README [here](https://github.com/pamelakaylin/Bucketbee_Client).
